## lecture1: history of CV and introduction to CNNs
+ ImageNet:
Annual competition for image classification, started in 2010.
+ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):
Introduced by Yann LeCun in 1998, CNNs are a type of neural network designed for processing structured grid data, such as images.
CNN show great performance in image classification tasks.

## lecture2: Image Classification Pipeline
#### Attemps:
- find edges then corners: don't work well.
- Use large datasets with labels.
#### Classifiers
**1. First classifier: Nearest Neighbors (NN):**
Find the closest image in the dataset to the input image.
- Distance metric:
    - L1 distance: sum of absolute differences.
